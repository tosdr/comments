    "tldr": "Clever maintains that, in accordance with FERPA, it will only share Student Data with third parties when instructed to do so by the school. \n\nIt is unclear whether School authorization would also be required to transfer Student Data in the event of a merger or dissolution, or whether Clever would even notify Schools (or students) that data has been transferred.
