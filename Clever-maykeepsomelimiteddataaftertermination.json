    "tldr": "Clever deletes all “student data” within 72 hours of the School terminating service, but may keep the School’s profile content for a “commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes.”\n\nClever may also keep “anonymized or aggregated data, including usage data.” It is unclear whether this includes de-identified student data or how data would be anonymized.
