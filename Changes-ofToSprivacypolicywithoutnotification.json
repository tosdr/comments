    "tldr": "Wordfeud/Bertheussen IT has the right to change their ToS and privacy policy at any time and is not required to notify the users. Also, users will not be asked for their consent: continued use of Wordfeud implies acceptance of these changes. The only way to object is by quitting Wordfeud."
